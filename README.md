I made this Discord bot for a person, but they no longer paid for the bot, so I thought it would be best to post it here.
- This bot also has some interesting functions, I'll leave them to you to discover.

## Requirements : NodeJS & MongoDB

## INSTALLATION STEPTS :
- EXTRACT FOLDER WITH BOT-FILES ON DESKTOP.
- OPEN VISUAL STUDIO CODE TO OPEN THE TERMINAL / OPEN TERMINAL FROM CMD.
- INSTALL MONGODB & NODEJS
- CONFIG YOUR BOT IN .env
- run in cmd :
  ```
  cd findro
  npm install
  node index.js```
